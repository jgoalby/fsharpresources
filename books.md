[Expert F# 4.0](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-F-4-0-Don-Syme-ebook/dp/B0171AK8F8/)

Written by F#'s inventor and two major F# community members, Expert F# 4.0 is a comprehensive and in-depth guide to the language and its use. Designed to help others become experts, the book quickly yet carefully describes the paradigms supported by F# language, and then shows how to use F# elegantly for practical web, data, parallel and analytical programming tasks.

[F# for Machine Learning Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Essentials-Sudipta-Mukherjee-ebook/dp/B017M936XY/)

Starting with an introduction to the several categories on machine learning, you will quickly learn to implement time-tested, supervised learning algorithms. You will gradually move on to solving problems on predicting housing pricing using Regression Analysis. You will then learn to use Accord . NET to implement SVM techniques and clustering. You will also learn to build a recommender system for your e-commerce site from scratch. Finally, you will dive into advanced topics such as implementing neural network algorithms while performing sentiment analysis on your data.

[Learning F# Functional Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Functional-Data-Structures-Algorithms-ebook/dp/B00YSILAYU/)

Starting with the fundamental concepts of F# and functional programming, this book will walk you through basic problems, helping you to write functional and maintainable code. Using easy-to-understand examples, you will learn how to design data structures and algorithms in F# and apply these concepts in real-life projects. The book will cover built-in data structures and take you through enumerations and sequences. You will gain knowledge about stacks, graph-related algorithms, and implementations of binary trees. Next, you will understand the custom functional implementation of a queue, review sets and maps, and explore the implementation of a vector. Finally, you will find resources and references that will give you a comprehensive overview of F# ecosystem, helping you to go beyond the fundamentals.

[The Book of F#](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Breaking-Managed-Functional-Programming-ebook/dp/B00IZNQULW/)

In The Book of F#, Microsoft MVP Dave Fancher shares his expertise and teaches you how to wield the power of F# to write succinct, reliable, and predictable code. As you learn to take advantage of features like default immutability, pipelining, type inference, and pattern matching, you'll be amazed at how efficient and elegant your code can be.
